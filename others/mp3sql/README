    			   Welcome dear user!

This product is made by me, Daniel Andersson <daniel@sto.sema.se>, to help
people to index their MP3s in SQL databases. I can't in any way garantee that
this product will work for you. There are some known problems with filenames
that contains " and other type of characters that the Unix shell dosen't handle
so well. I myself use the MySQL and therefore most of the included examples are
for MySQL only... And i know that the examples are not optimized in speed or 
database size, but it all works (at least for me)...

To use the PERL program i have written som help scripts to do things i a faster
way if you have alott of CD's with MP3s

The LIST.SH is for mounting, reading mp3's and then unmount and eject the CD. 
To use the outputed list with MySQL the folowing line would go fine :

mysql -p < mp3database

If you get errors from the above commando there is probably becuase of bad
filenames or that you don't have access to the local mysql database. Or you
hadn't initilaized the database with the create_database.sh script yet.

I have also included an simple .html and .phtml to search in the database.
New in version 1.1.0.1 is that the search engine displays if the file is online
or not! I have also included some sort functions.

Another new thing is the addtoplaylist.cgi and player.sh that is an "JukeBox"
you chose the songs that you want to play from the searches you have done and
then it starts playing (if you have player.sh running), if there are no songs
in the playlist the player.sh uses an list of all your online MP3s and
randomizes.
