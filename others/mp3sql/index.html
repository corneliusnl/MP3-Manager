This is in no way an fancy page, it only does what it shall and nothing
more! <BR><BR>

MP3SQL is an product that takes a look at your MP3s and extract the tags
into an textfile with the apropiate SQL commands. It also includes the
size of the file. <BR><BR>

The current version is v1.0.0.1 and is working for me <BR><BR>
