BHRPFF
Ben Hates Reading Poorly Formatted Filenames.
(C) Benjamin James Cooper. Winter 1999.

1. Installing BHRPFF:

   Extract the archive containing the source code. 

   Under Unix or BeOS[0] this can be done with gzip:
       $ tar xzvf filename.tar.gz
     or
       $ gzip -dc filename.tar.bz2 | tar xf -

   Or with bzip2 in Unix or BeOS:
       $ tar xIvf filename.tar.bz2
     or
       $ bzip2 -dc filename.tar.bz2 | tar xf -

   Your on your own if you use Windows or MacOS.

2. How to use BHRPFF:

   BHRPFF is run from the command prompt like most Perl[1] applications.

   The script is called bhrpff.pl, it takes a list of filenames as its
   options. There is one option -N, which when set assumes that you wish
   bhrpff to change the names of all the given files without asking you.

   Examples:
      $ ./bhrpff.pl -N ./mymp3collection/*
      $ ./bhrpff.pl ./mymp3collection/* ./oldfiles/*

3. Known problems.

   BHRPFF isn't a magic bullet and if you fix any of these without
   screwing other things up let me know and I will be happy to include
   your changes.

   i.   Squeezed Text
      
        If a given token, seen as one word should really be two. Some files
        are named, BenHatesThis.

   ii.  Bastardized Netscape Filenames
        
        If you have saved a file with spaces from netscape, it will look
        like: Ben_%20Hates_%20This. The following regex would fix the
        problem but it can convert song numbers too so I took it out.

	s/\_(\d\d)/chr($1)/eg;
	where $_ is the filename.

   iii. Files which have "seperating" characters in tokens.

        Example:
	   Ben - Hates This (Re-mix).text

	   Comes out to:

	   Ben - Hates This - Re (Mix).text

       What is needed is a more sophisticated method of typing special
       characters, this would be easier to do in a language which had
       types.
