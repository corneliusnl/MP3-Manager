- relative->absolute pathname conversion in main.C
  not as robust as it should be.
- Recursive directory scanner - ListFilesUnder() 
  returns the first file in the previous directory
  twice whenever it changes directories. 
- Need to go through memory management and add
  delete[] commands where appropriate.
- Won't scan more than 8192 mp3 files at a time.
  This just how the stack is initialized - you
  can change it by modifying the source and
  recompiling.
