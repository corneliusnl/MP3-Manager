TODO:

- Make relative->absolute path conversion more
  robust.
- Create a 'media' field to tell the database
  what host / cd / medium the mp3 came from.
  Useful for nfs mounted stuff.
- Support for mysql
- Better plugin architecture - this one sucks.
- Support for iODBC / any ODBC-compliant driver.
- A config file for storing things like passwords
  usernames, and whatnot.
- Support for the earlier MP2 format.  Still need
  to check and see if MP2's even /use/ tags.
- Put a nicer interface (possible tcl/tk?) on it.
- Add some signal handling code.  I'd like to be
  able to increase the DEBUG level via SIGUSR1 and
  SIGUSR2, as well as some code to exit gracefully
  incase the user closes his terminal before the
  program exits.
- Become a better programmer.
