Hello!  This is an /beta/ release.  All the features aren't
here, and the few that are here may have bugs I haven't
found.  If you find a bug, e-mail me at:

1. Description of program
----------------------

Point the program to a directory, and it will recursively
scan for MP3 files.  When it finds them, it will extract
the ID3 tag (if available) from it, and display the
results to you, or upload it to a database.

Currently there are only plans for postgresql support.
In the future, I hope to add mysql and access to
iODBC for accessing any ODBC-compliant driver that
runs under linux.  

2. Licensing
---------

See the COPYING file.

3. Compilation instructions
------------------------

NOTE: If you are using redhat, you need to 
install the postgresql-devel and glibc-devel
packages before you can compile.

If you are using any other distribution,
you need to install postgresql's 
libpq, which is included in the standard
distribution available from www.postgresql.org.
I think debian has some .debs for postgresql..
check your user manual. ;)

Extract this archive to an empty directory,
and then cd into it.  Type 'make'.
The completed file will be "mp3db" in the
current directory.  

There is a statically-linked executable
included in this package.  If you can't
get this program to compile for some
reason, use this one instead.

4. How to use this program
-----------------------

You need to have configured a database.  It needs
to have the following fields defined for one of it's tables 
('mp3data' is the default table name):

Recommended		 Alternates
------------------------+-----------------------
bool tag		| Can also be any int type or char[1]
varchar filename	| char[1024] should work.
int8 size		| Can also be char[10] (most files won't be > 1 GB)
varchar artist		| Can also be a char[30]
varchar title		| ""
varchar genre		| Can also be char[18]
varchar album		| ""
varchar comment		| ""
int4 year		| Can also be a char[4]

It is beyond the scope of this document to tell you how to set up 
your database.  Please consult the user's manual for details on
creating a table with these attributes.

After you have successfully setup your database, ./mp3db -h
will give you a list of all the available commands and drivers.

As of this writing, the following drivers are available:

raw	| writes out the mp3 tags in tab-delimited format
sql	| writes out the raw sql commands to update a database
pgsql	| Connects to a PostgreSQL database and updates
	  everything it finds.

5. Programmer notes
----------------

Some random code is stuck under ./examples...
it's just some stuff I'm hacking together to
try to add into the main program at a future
date.  Some of the stuff may not compile,
or may require a library you don't have
(argtable comes to mind).  You can
safely blow away the directory...
