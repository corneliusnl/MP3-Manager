Introduction
============
id3 Renamer is used to rename batches of mpeg3 files by reading the ID3 tag
at the end of the file which contains the song name, artist, album, year,
and a comment.  The secondary function of id3 Renamer is a tagger, which
can create, modify, or remove ID3 tags.

If you have questions, comments, or bugs mail me at badcrc@tscnet.com.

Notes
=====
- Config files should only contain the exact same options as specified on
  the command line.  You can use # at the beginning of a line for a comment.
  Spaces at the beginning of a line are ignored.  NOTE: There is a couple
  differences when putting things into the config file as opposed to the
  command line:
  1) EVERY character in a config file is read as part of the option.  For
     example, if your template on the command line was:
     -template="[$a] [$s].mp3"         (The shell interprets the quotes)
     Then in the config file it would just be:
     -template=[$a] [$s].mp3           (id3ren reads the entire option as is)
  2) Spaces in between an option and its argument are read as part of the
     argument.  For example, if "-album    In Deep" is in the config file,
     id3ren will set the album to "   In Deep" (including the spaces).

- id3ren first reads all command line options.  If it doesn't find the
  "-nocfg" command line option, it looks for config files in this order:
  1) Reads environment variable ID3REN which should contain the complete
     path to a config file.  If variable doesn't exist or file not found
     then...
  2) Reads environment variable HOME.  In Linux it looks for $HOME/.id3renrc.
     In Win32 it looks for $HOME\id3ren.rc.  If variable doesn't exist or
     file not found then...
  3) In Linux it looks for /etc/id3renrc.  In Win32 it looks for id3ren.rc in
     the directory where id3ren.exe is located.
