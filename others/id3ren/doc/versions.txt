id3ren Versions
===============
0.97a
=====
- Fixed a short->int screw up on my part that was causing weird things to
  happen...Solaris got a bus error, 95 and Linux didn't read certain options
  correctly.
- Changed usage screen for Linux to "for *nix" cause ascii doesn't like
  things for Linux on his Solaris box.

0.97
====
- Added -edit option.
- Several options are now toggles.  For example if you specify -verbose
  in a config file, then you want to disable verbose mode one time, you
  can specify -verbose on the command line and it will disable it for that
  one use.  Options that aren't toggles: -quick, -showtag, -defcase, -upper,
  -lower....and any other option that accepts a second argument, or displays
  info (i.e., -showgen, -help, -template, -space, etc).
- Included some sample rc files in the samples directory.

0.96
====
- Included source in archive, with a Makefile for both Linux and Win32.
- Added -nocfg, -nogenre, -remchar, -repchar, -verbose options.
- Added support for config files.  See id3ren.txt for info.
- You can now change specific parts of a tag if a file already has a tag.
  For example, if you have a file that has a tag and only want to change
  the album name, you can use -tag in conjunction with -album.  You will
  still be prompted for other tag info if they are blank unless you use
  the -noalbum, -nocomment, -nogenre, -noyear, etc. options.
