  Berkeley Quality Software /adj./  (often abbreviated `BQS')
    Term used in a pejorative sense to refer to software that was
    apparently created by rather spaced-out hackers late at night to
    solve some unique problem.  It usually has nonexistent, incomplete,
    or incorrect documentation, has been tested on at least two
    examples, and core dumps when anyone else attempts to use it.

  Quick Install Guide
  -------------------
      % gzip -d mp3html-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
      % tar xvf mp3html-X.Y.Z.tar
      % cd mp3html-X.Y.Z/
      % make
      % make install    (become root if necessary)

  Make sure to read 'CHANGES' for information about what's different
  between versions.

  If you want to use MP3html under DOS or similar, you can try using "make
  dos", although that will probably only work with DJGPP
  <http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/> and might not even work then.  To compile
  with a generic C compiler, just load mp3html.c and attempt to build it.

  If anyone with a Windows/DOS compiler reads this, please try to compile
  MP3html and let me know how it turned out and what, if anything, you
  needed to do to get it running.  Thanks.

  MP3html is a utility to make configurable listings of MP3 (MPEG Layer 3)
  files based on their ID3v1 tags.  It was originally just a hacked-together
  interface to some ID3 routines I wrote because I was bored.  Since then, it
  has evolved into something that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike
  a useful program.

  As an added bonus, MP3html is free for use and modification under the
  terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 (or, at your option,
  any later version).  This means you have full access to the source code
  and permission to modify and redistribute it as long as you credit me and
  don't make any money from it.  Heck, I don't get paid for it, so why
  should you?

  As of the 1.3.X series, MP3html has been completely rewritten and is much
  more powerful and configurable.  Yippee!  In fact, the 1.3.X series of
  releases are merely betas.  Once MP3html is stable and all the known bugs
  are worked out, version 2.0.0 will be released and I can finally take a
  break from actively developing this monster.

  MP3html works by reading information from MP3s files and then using
  templates containg codes like '$FILENAME' and '$ARTIST' to create
  configurable lists of MP3s.  This section should show you how to use it.

  For information about the tags that go in the template files, check out
  the file 'TAGS'.

  Commandline (this needs to be improved - until then, read the man page)
  -----------
    There are only two required elements on the commandline.  They are: a
    template and some MP3 files.

    The template can be supplied in one of three ways.  You can specify a
    file that contains the codes by putting the filename on the commandline
    before any MP3s, you can specify the codes with the "-t" option or you
    can use one of the builtin templates (not currently available).

    Likewise, the MP3s can be specified in a few ways.  You can put their
    filenames on the commandline (you can use wildcards), you can specify a
    playlist full of filenames with the "-p" parameter, or you can have
    MP3html recursively load a directory tree with the "-r" option.

    Unlike earlier versions of MP3html (1.0.0 - 1.2.4), you do not need to
    specify a header and footer template.  You can, though.  Just use "-H"
    followed by a filename for a header and "-F" followed by a filename for
    a footer template.  If you want to define headers and footers on the
    commandline instead of by filename, "-h" will help you for headers and
    "-f" will serve your needs in the footer department.

    If you are using MP3html from a script and want to be able to set
    certain tags from the commandline, the "-D" option is for you.  The
    syntax for it is "-D TAGNAME=TAGDATA" and it will substitute all
    occurences of TAGNAME with TAGDATA in any of the templates.

    The other options to MP3html are there to change the output in small
    ways.  Using "-S" will substitute spaces for underscores in all the
    $FILENAME and related tags.  The "-u" option will substitute the
    following text for any unknown ID3 fields.  Putting a filename after
    "-o" will write to that file instead of stdout.  If you are using the
    "$INCREMENT" tag, using the "-i" parameter allows you to set the
    initial value (it defaults to 1).  "--trim-the" will remove any leading
    instances of "The " from the artist name (so "The Beach Boys" becomes
    "Beach Boys"), this is useful for building sorted lists.
    "--stereo-text" and "--mono-text" both accept a text string as an
    argument and modify the behavior of "$STEREO" to reflect that (ie. if
    the file is in stereo, the value in "--stereo-text" will be used and
    "--mono-text"'s value willbe used for mono files).


  Sample Commandlines
  -------------------
  These show different ways of achieving things.  You should be able to
  figure it out.


    To create "list.html" using template "tmplt" from MP3s in "../mp3/"

        mp3html tmplt -o list.html ../mp3/*      -or-
	mp3html tmplt -r ../mp3/ > list.html


    To use header and footer templates as well:

        mp3html tmplt -H header -F footer -o list.html -r ../mp3/*


    To list just song names to stdout:

        mp3html -t '$TITLE' ../mp3/*


    To list song names and artists and specify that they came from a CD:

        mp3html -t '$ARTIST - $TITLE ($CD)' -D '$CD' "Disc 1" ../mp3/*

  When I rewrote MP3html for 1.3.0, I also redid the ID3v1 routines and
  greatly extended them.  They are now in the 'libid3' directory and should
  be documented in 'libid3/README'.  Anyone interested in adding ID3v1
  support to their programs is highly encouraged to take a look at my
  little library.

  Lyrics3 support is in the extreme alpha stages of being added to libid3
  and will (hopefully) be available by the time 2.0.0 is released.

  I am considering adding ID3v2 support to MP3html.  If enough people email
  me and ask me to add ID3v2 support, then I will look into it more heavily.
