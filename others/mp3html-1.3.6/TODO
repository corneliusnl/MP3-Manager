TODO: Stuff I'm planning on doing with MP3html some time in the future

If you've got any requests, email me with them.

  + = Fairly big priority
  - = Not very important
  ? = Just considering it, not sure

Just as a note, there's a very good chance that the syntax and options will
change drastically between versions.  In that case, though, the minor
version number (1.X.0) will increase.  If stuff is just fixed and/or added,
the patch number (1.0.X) will increase.  The major version number (X.0.0)
will rarely increase (generally only in the case of a major rewrite).

Of course, during beta series (like the 1.3.X series), all those rules are
thrown out the window and I'm free to do whatever I damn well please
between versions.

+ Finally add sorting to the linked list code!
+ Add $TIME/$DATE tags
+ Add builtin templates to the code (what cmdline options should they be?)
+ Write some good docs and man/info pages (I've started on this)
- Add autoconf support (I should probably get help with the Makefile)
- Add summary option (dunno what syntax, though)
- Utility to create scripts and templates for use with (My)SQL databases
- New option to only process ID3 tags starting with certain letters
- Support for VBR (Variable BitRate) MP3s.  I need the filespecs.
- VQF/AAC/etc support (I need to find filespecs for these)
- Make RPM/Deb packages available. Anyone wanna volunteer to help?
- Add ID3v2 support
- Add Lyrics3 support (add-on to libid3 in progress, sorta)
- Different output files by first letter/etc
- Option to convert '&' into "&amp;" and similar in tags
- Add conditionals to the templates (ie. $IFARTIST artist $ENDIF)
? Add ID3v1.1 support (does anyone actually use this?)
? New utilities: cleanid3, id3image, fixmp3
? Make "-r --recurse" the default behavior if it finds a directory
