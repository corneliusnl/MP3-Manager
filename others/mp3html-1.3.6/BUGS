subst.c: time tags are wrong when using VBR (Variable Bit Rate) MP3 files

llist.c: Still no sorting/swapping

subst.c: substitute_tags() uses constants where there should be dynamic
    variables (this might not be fixed anytime soon as it doesn't really
    affect anything except my self esteem)

subst.c: incrementing variable is poorly initialized.  Nothing big.

libid3: still a few unresolved issues (tag stripping isn't yet implemented)
