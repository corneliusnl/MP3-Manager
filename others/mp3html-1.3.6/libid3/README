libid3 0.1.0 by Ben Canning <bdc@bdc.cx>
--
  This is a small library for reading and writing ID3v1 tags to and from
  MP3 files.  It was developed for use with MP3html by the same author.

  I'm now adding Lyrics3 support to libid3 as an optional addon.  It's not
  going to be integrated very closely with the actual library, but it's too
  small and pathetic to stand on it's own.  Look at lyrics3.c for a bit
  more information.
