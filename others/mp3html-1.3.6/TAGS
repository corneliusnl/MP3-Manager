TAGS
--
  This file documents the tags that MP3html supports.  Each tag is
  preceeded by a dollarsign ('$') when used in a template.  Some of the
  tags, mainly the ones that begin with 'TOTAL' are intended for use in
  headers and footers, not middle templates.  Remember that all tags are
  case sensitive.

  In each example, the tag name is followed by some text in parenthesis.
  That is an example of the output from the tag.

  As you can see, the song I am using for these examples is "Whiskey In The
  Jar" by the Celtic rock group Wylde Nept.  The song is great and is
  available for free download at mp3.com.

  FILENAME (Wylde Nept - Whiskey In The Jar.mp3)
  --
  This is the filename of the MP3 without any path attached to it.

  
  PATHFILENAME (/home/mp3/Celtic/Wylde Nept - Whiskey In The Jar.mp3)
  --
  The same as $FILENAME but it includes the whole path as gathered from
  the commandline.  If you give it a relative path ("../mp3/Celtic/*"),
  then this would contain "../mp3/Celtic/Wylde Nept - ..." instead.


  BITRATE (256)
  --
  A numerical value indicating the bitrate of encoding.

  
  FREQUENCY (44100)
  --
  The frequency of the recording.


  LAYER (3)
  --
  A numerical value incating the layer of MPEG encoding used (most
  often 3, but occasionally it will be 2).
  

  LAYERROMAN (III)
  --
  The same as $LAYER but in roman numeral form.  Some people like this
  more.
  

  VERSION (1)
  --
  The version of MPEG encoding used on the file.  Supported versions
  are 1, 2, and 2.5.


  LENGTH (205)
  --
  The total number of seconds in the song.

  
  LENGTHSECONDS (25)
  --
  The number of seconds modulo 60.  That is, the number of seconds that
  don't fit into a whole minute.  See the next tag for a hint.


  LENGTHMINUTES (3)
  --
  The number of whole minutes in the song.  If you want to have it look
  like "3:25", use "$LENGTHMINUTES:$LENGTHSECONDS".
  

  TOTALLENGTH (614)
  --
  The total number of seconds in every song you specified.
 
  
  TOTALLENGTHSECONDS (14)
  --
  Same as $LENGTHSECONDS but applied to every song.

  
  TOTALLENGTHMINUTES (10)
  --
  Same as $LENGTHMINUTES but applied to every song.

  
  AVGLENGTH (185)
  --
  Average length (in seconds) of every song.


  AVGLENGTHSECONDS (5)
  --
  Same as $LENGTHSECONDS, but an average of every song.


  $AVGLENGTHMINUTES (3)
  --
  Same as $LENGTHMINUTES, but an average of every song.


  TOTALFILES (4)
  --
  The total number of songs that MP3html has analyzed.


  FILESIZE (3367605)

  Number of whole megabytes in the current song.


  FILESIZEKB (3288)
  --
  Number of whole kilobytes in the current song.

  
  TOTALFILESIZE (32852190)
  --
  Same as $FILESIZE but applied to all the songs.

  
  TOTALFILESIZEMB (32)
  --
  Same as $FILESIZEMB but applied to all the songs.

  
  TOTALFILESIZEKB
  --
  Same as $FILESIZEKB but applied to all the songs.


  AVGFILESIZE
  --
  Average size (in bytes) of all the files.


  AVGFILESIZEKB
  --
  Average size (in kilobytes) of all the files.


  AVGFILESIZEMB
  --
  Average size (in megabytes) of all the files.

  INCREMENT (1)
  --
  This is an automatically incrementing number that starts at 1 (or what
  ever value is specified by "-i --increment") and counts up. That way, you
  can assign numbers to your MP3 files easily.  Sample output for a
  template of "$INCREMENT - $TITLE" might look something like this:

      1 - Tom Dooley
      2 - M.T.A
      3 - The Tijuana Jail
      4 - Scotch & Soda
  
  This tag works with negative numbers as well, but make sure not to assign
  a starting value of -32768 as that will cause the tag to always show that
  value (I'll fix this eventually).


  MP3HTMLVERSION (1.3.4)
  --
  The version of MP3html used.


  MP3HTMLDATE (May 28 1999)
