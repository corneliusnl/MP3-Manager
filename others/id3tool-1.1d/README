id3tool: a program for manipulating mp3 ID3 Tags

Using id3tool:
--==========--
id3tool should be fairly straight forward.

run it with "-h" to get usage.

no flags, with a filename prints the tags

--set-blah flags with a filename sets the ID3 tag

id3tool now also has a manpage [a really dodgey one yes, but a
manpage].  If somebody volunteers to write a better manpage, I will
consider whatever is produced.

History:
--====--
id3tool was written as a test program for a small id3 stub I'd written
for the "Ultimate MP3 Player" which is still a concept, and no code ;)
Having made a useful tool for setting ID3 tags [I hate GUI tag
editors] I decided I might as well tidy it up and release it.

The ID3 tag stub was originally written under windows, using ANSI C,
and copied over to linux where it worked perfectly first time. [yay!]

id3.c can still be ripped out of id3tool to provide id3 tag
manipulaiton functionality for other programs under the terms of the
GPL.

Originally, I wasn't going to have any Win32 support, but somebody
submitted a patch - so I've incorporated it with some `corrections'.

The Future of id3tool:
--==================--
Well, lets just say that id3tool is a bit of a tutorial exercise at
least.  Its likely to be used as a victim for all sorts of tweaks and
modifications over time, and is likely to gain all sorts of front
ends.  [Tag editor front ends are thankfully very simple].

If there are any features you want to see that are reasonable, let me
know, and I'll try to add them when I find the time.

Donations: 
--======-- 
If you want to make me feel all nice and fuzzy for writing this,
please send me Music CDs or non-intel Hardware... I could always do
with more of both. :) Email me for my current postal address.

Alternatively, you could do the Samba thing, and buy me some Pizza ;)

Finale!:

Anyhows, Thats enough from me now...

Copyright/License Blurb:
--====================--

id3tool has absolutely NOTHING to do with my former employers/company:
EcomServ Pty Ltd, 
EcomTel, or 
EcomTech.
nor my current employers:
John Curtin School of Medical Research, or
The Australian National University
Its a independant work that has been completely developed on my own
time.

Happy Hacking
