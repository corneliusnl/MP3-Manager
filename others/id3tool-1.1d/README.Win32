The Win32 Port is originally by Steve Kemp.

The diffs he submitted were a bit messy, and the makefile was not
acceptible in the state in which he submitted it.

However, the getopt.[ch] files were accepted, and some of the source
changes were also accepted.

For build instructions, please refer to INSTALL.
